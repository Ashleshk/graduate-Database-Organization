# Netflix-database-management-system

The objective of this project is to analyze the customer database & help Netflix make business decisions and recommendations.

### Dataset

The Netflix database was generated using Mockaroo tool to include Customer details, Invoice details, Content, Stream details. The dataset consists of 500 customers across United States, Germany and Australia who have made 1000 transactions with their invoice based on available 3 plans: Basic, Standard and Premium. Content and Stream has 500 instances each.

### Database Queries

This project follows 2nd Normalization form and the ER diagram was developed using MySQL workbench to show the relationship between the 4 entities. Oracle Live SQL was used to develop the following queries to understand the customer database and their interaction with Netflix content data:
1. To determine the total cost of the content and the revenue per content 
2. To determine worth of content acquisition, average rating of each content and trends of content to help Netflix discontinue contents not being watched by its user base
3. To determine the total revenue generated by the customer base in specific country per plan
